  abstract  = "The human striatum can be subdivided into the caudate, putamen,
               and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Each of these structures have some
               overlapping and some distinct functions related to motor
               control, cognitive processing, motivation, and reward.
               Previously, we used a ``time-of-death'' approach to identify
               diurnal rhythms in RNA transcripts in human cortical regions.
               Here, we identify molecular rhythms across the three striatal
               subregions collected from postmortem human brain tissue in
               subjects without psychiatric or neurological disorders. Core
               circadian clock genes are rhythmic across all three regions and
               show strong phase concordance across regions. However, the
               putamen contains a much larger number of significantly rhythmic
               transcripts than the other two regions. Moreover, there are many
               differences in pathways that are rhythmic across regions.
               Strikingly, the top rhythmic transcripts in NAc (but not the
               other regions) are predominantly small nucleolar RNAs and long
               noncoding RNAs, suggesting that a completely different mechanism
               might be used for the regulation of diurnal rhythms in
               translation and/or RNA processing in the NAc versus the other
               regions. Further, although the NAc and putamen are generally in
               phase with regard to timing of expression rhythms, the NAc and
               caudate, and caudate and putamen, have several clusters of
               discordant rhythmic transcripts, suggesting a temporal wave of
               specific cellular processes across the striatum. Taken together,
               these studies reveal distinct transcriptome rhythms across the
               human striatum and are an important step in helping to
               understand the normal function of diurnal rhythms in these
               regions and how disruption could lead to pathology.",

               time of day is rarely considered when brain responses are
               studied by neuroimaging techniques. To address this issue, we
               explicitly examined the effects of circadian and homeostatic
               regulation on functional connectivity (FC) and regional cerebral
               blood flow (rCBF) in healthy human volunteers, using whole-brain
               resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
               and arterial spin labeling (ASL). In common with many circadian
               studies, we collected salivary cortisol to represent the normal
               circadian activity and functioning of the
               hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Intriguingly, the
               changes in FC and rCBF we observed indicated fundamental
               decreases in the functional integration of the default mode
               network (DMN) moving from morning to afternoon. Within the
               anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), our results indicate that
               morning cortisol levels are negatively correlated with rCBF. We
               hypothesize that the homeostatic mechanisms of the HPA axis has
               a role in modulating the functional integrity of the DMN
               (specifically, the ACC), and for the purposes of using fMRI as a
               tool to measure changes in disease processes or in response to

              deprivation and how they deviate from regular daily variability.
              To this end, we obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging
              data from 60 young, adult male participants, scanned in the
              morning and evening of the same day and again the following
              morning. 41 participants underwent total sleep deprivation before
              the third scan, whereas the remainder had another night of
              regular sleep. Sleep deprivation strongly altered the
              connectivity of several resting-state networks, including dorsal
              attention, default mode, and hippocampal networks. Multivariate

              connectivity changes were reverted by sleep (control group)-a
              pattern which did not occur after deprivation. We conclude that

              robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing
              and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely
              used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly

              adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their
              reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific
              implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging
              datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated,
              volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical

              software to measure the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), defined
              as the ratio of the brain parenchymal volume and intracranial
              volume, thus accounting for variations in head size. The MRI data
              came from serial scans of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in
              clinical trials (n=755, 3269 scans) and from subjects
              participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
              (ADNI, n=834, 6114 scans). The percent change in BPF was modeled
              with a linear mixed effect (LME) model, and the model was applied
              separately to the MS and ADNI datasets. The LME model for the MS
              datasets included random subject effects (intercept and slope
              over time) and fixed effects for the time-of-day, time from the
              baseline scan, and trial, which accounted for trial-related
              effects (for example, different inclusion criteria and imaging
              protocol). The model for ADNI additionally included the
              demographics (baseline age, sex, subject type [normal, mild
              cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease], and interaction
              between subject type and time from baseline). There was a
              statistically significant effect of time-of-day on the BPF change
              in MS clinical trial datasets (-0.180 per day, that is, 0.180\%
              of intracranial volume, p=0.019) as well as the ADNI dataset
              (-0.438 per day, that is, 0.438\% of intracranial volume,
              p<0.0001), showing that the brain volume is greater in the
              morning. Linearly correcting the BPF values with the time-of-day
              reduced the required sample size to detect a 25\% treatment
              effect (80\% power and 0.05 significance level) on change in

              our understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD)

              a vascular disease. Despite numerous studies examining CBF in BD,
              there has not yet been a review of the literature on the topic of
              CBF in BD. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature on CBF
              in BD was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Studies included
              measured CBF by single-photon emission computerized tomography
              (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), arterial spin
              labelling (ASL) or perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) in a group of
              BD patients. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies with a total of 508
              subjects with BD and 538 controls were included (n = 15 SPECT; n
              = 8 PET; n = 7 ASL; n = 1 PWI; n = 2 other). The majority of
              studies in BD depression and mania reported widespread resting
              hypoperfusion in cingulate gyrus, frontal, and anterior temporal
              regions in comparison to healthy controls (HC). Findings in
              euthymic BD subjects and in symptomatically heterogeneous groups
              were less consistent. Studies that examined CBF responses to
              cognitive or emotional stimuli in BD subjects have reported
              hypoperfusion or different regions involved in comparison to HC.
              LIMITATIONS: Important methodological heterogeneity between
              studies, and small number of subjects per study. CONCLUSIONS: The
              most consistent findings to date are hypoperfusion in BD mood
              episodes, and hypoactive CBF responses to emotional or cognitive
              challenges. Future studies examining CBF are warranted, including

               of the spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) signal vs flip

               two-point extrapolation to signal null with a correction scheme
               while T(1) mapping uses the slopes of the SPGR signal vs flip
               angle curves near the origin and near the signal null. This new
               method improves upon the existing variable flip angle (VFA)
               T(1)-mapping method in that (i) consistency between B(1) and
               T(1) maps is ensured (ii) the sampling scheme is
               T(1)-independent (iii) the noise bias and singularity,
               associated with using a linear form for the SPGR signal
               equation, is eliminated by using the full equation. The method
               is shown to yield accurate and robust results via simulations.
               Initial estimates of B(1) and T(1) values are obtained from
               three data points via simple computations and straight line
               approximations. Initial estimates of B(1) values, for a range of
               values, are shown to be accurate due to the proposed B(1)
               correction scheme. The accuracy and robustness of T(1) values is
               achieved via a non-linear fitting algorithm which includes a
               fourth data point sampled at high SNR. The MoS was validated by
               comparing resulting B(1) and T(1) maps with those obtained using
               other standard methods. Finally, the ability to obtain brain
               B(1) and T(1) maps using the MoS was demonstrated by in vivo

              METHODS: PRISMA-based systematic review of the literature.
              RESULTS: The acute antidepressant (AD) efficacy of LT was
              supported by several open-label studies, three randomized
              controlled trials (RCTs), and one pseudorandomized controlled
              trial. SD showed rapid, acute AD response rates of 43.9\%,
              59.3\%, and 59.4\% in eight case series, 11 uncontrolled,
              studies, and one RCT, respectively. Adjunctive DT obtained
              significant, rapid anti-manic results in one RCT and one
              controlled study. The seven studies on MA yielded very limited
              data on acute antidepressant activity, conflicting evidence of
              both antimanic and maintenance efficacy, and support from two
              case series of improved sleep in both acute and euthymic states.
              IPSRT monotherapy for bipolar II depression had acute response
              rates of 41\%, 67\%, and 67.4\% in two open studies and one RCT,
              respectively; as adjunctive therapy for bipolar depression in one
              RCT, and efficacy in reducing relapse in two RCTs. Among euthymic

              across cognitive domains, and sleep deprivation can have rapid
              antidepressive effects in mood disorders. However, the
              neurobiological effects of waking and sleep are not well
              understood. Recently, animal studies indicated that waking and
              sleep are associated with substantial cortical structural
              plasticity. Here, we hypothesized that structural plasticity can
              be observed after a day of waking and sleep deprivation in the
              human cerebral cortex. To test this hypothesis, 61 healthy adult
              males underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
              three time points: in the morning after a regular night's sleep,
              the evening of the same day, and the next morning, either after
              total sleep deprivation (N=41) or a night of sleep (N=20). We
              found significantly increased right prefrontal cortical thickness
              from morning to evening across all participants. In addition,
              pairwise comparisons in the deprived group between the two
              morning scans showed significant thinning of mainly bilateral
              medial parietal cortices after 23h of sleep deprivation,
              including the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. However,
              there were no significant group (sleep vs. sleep deprived group)
              by time interactions and we can therefore not rule out that other
              mechanisms than sleep deprivation per se underlie the bilateral
              medial parietal cortical thinning observed in the deprived group.
              Nonetheless, these cortices are thought to subserve wakefulness,
              are among the brain regions with highest metabolic rate during
              wake, and are considered some of the most sensitive cortical
              regions to a variety of insults. Furthermore, greater thinning
              within the left medial parietal cluster was associated with
              increased sleepiness after sleep deprivation. Together, these
              findings add to a growing body of data showing rapid structural
              plasticity within the human cerebral cortex detectable with MRI.
              Further studies are needed to clarify whether cortical thinning
              is one neural substrate of sleepiness after sleep deprivation.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: We aimed to systematically review recent publications
              (01/2014-03/2017) with longitudinal designs allowing for the
              assessment of the prospective risk of insomnia on new onset
              mental illness in key conditions: anxiety, depression, bipolar
              disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders,
              and suicide. RECENT FINDINGS: A literature yielded 1859 unique
              articles meeting search criteria were identified; 16 articles met
              all selection criteria and reviewed with some studies reporting
              on more than one mental health outcome. Overall, the review
              supports the hypothesis that insomnia is a predictor of
              subsequent mental illness. The evidence is strongest for an
              insomnia-depression relationship. The new studies identified and
              reviewed add to a modest number of publications supporting a
              prospective role of insomnia in new onset mental illness in three
              areas: anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and suicide. The few
              selected new studies focused on SUD were mixed, and no studies
              focused on PTSD were identified that met the selection criteria.
              Treatment of insomnia may also be a preventive mental health
              strategy.",

              disorder, and other mood disorders. These hypotheses include
              disruptions in monoamine transmission,

              disorders have significant disruptions in circadian rhythms and
              the sleep/wake cycle. In fact, altered sleep patterns are one of
              the major diagnostic criteria for these disorders. Moreover,
              environmental disruptions to circadian rhythms, including shift
              work, travel across time zones, and irregular social schedules,
              tend to precipitate or exacerbate mood-related episodes. Recent

              disruption of circadian rhythm may increase risk for malignant,
              psychiatric, metabolic, and other diseases. RESULTS: Extending
              our recent findings of oscillating cytosine modifications
              (osc-modCs) in mice, in this study, we show that osc-modCs are
              also prevalent in human neutrophils. Osc-modCs may play a role in
              gene regulation, can explain parts of intra- and inter-individual
              epigenetic variation, and are signatures of aging. Finally, we
              show that osc-modCs are linked to three complex diseases and
              provide a new interpretation of cross-sectional epigenome-wide
              association studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that loss
              of balance between cytosine methylation and demethylation during
              the circadian cycle can be a potential mechanism for complex
              disease. Additional experiments, however, are required to
              investigate the possible involvement of confounding effects, such
              as hidden cellular heterogeneity. Circadian rhythmicity, one of

              properties of the brain have been reported recently. These
              fluctuations may have a physiological origin, since they have
              been detected using different MRI modalities, and cannot be
              explained by factors that are typically known to confound MRI
              measures. While preliminary evidence suggests that measures of
              structural properties of the brain based on diffusion tensor
              imaging (DTI) fluctuate as a function of time-of-day (TOD), the
              underlying mechanism has not been investigated. Here, we used a
              longitudinal within-subjects design to investigate the impact of
              time-of-day on DTI measures. In addition to using the
              conventional monoexponential tensor model to assess TOD-related
              fluctuations, we used a dual compartment tensor model that
              allowed us to directly assess if any change in DTI measures is
              due to an increase in CSF/free-water volume fraction or due to an
              increase in water diffusivity within the parenchyma. Our results
              show that Trace or mean diffusivity, as measured using the
              conventional monoexponential tensor model tends to increase
              systematically from morning to afternoon scans at the interface
              of grey matter/CSF, most prominently in the major fissures and
              the sulci of the brain. Interestingly, in a recent study of the
              glymphatic system, these same regions were found to show late
              enhancement after intrathecal injection of a CSF contrast agent.
              The increase in Trace also impacts DTI measures of diffusivity
              such as radial and axial diffusivity, but does not affect
              fractional anisotropy. The dual compartment analysis revealed
              that the increase in diffusivity measures from PM to AM was
              driven by an increase in the volume fraction of CSF-like
              free-water. Taken together, our findings provide important
              insight into the likely physiological origins of diurnal

              disorder and to map the brain alterations linked to these
              disorders at the level of individual patients. Design, Setting,
              and Participants: This study used cross-sectional, T1-weighted
              magnetic resonance imaging data from participants recruited for
              the Thematically Organized Psychosis study from October 27, 2004,

              the Oslo area of Norway, and healthy individuals from the same

              Main Outcomes and Measures: Interindividual differences in brain
              structure among patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
              Voxel-based morphometry maps were computed, which were used for
              normative modeling to map the range of interindividual
              differences in brain structure. Results: This study included 218
              patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (mean [SD] age, 30
              [9.3] years; 126 [57.8\%] male), of whom 163 had schizophrenia
              (mean [SD] age, 31 [8.7] years; 105 [64.4\%] male) and 190 had
              bipolar disorder (mean [SD] age, 34 [11.3] years; 79 [41.6\%]

              years; 140 [54.7\%] male). At the level of the individual,
              deviations from the normative model were frequent in both
              disorders but highly heterogeneous. Overlap of more than 2\%
              among patients was observed in only a few loci, primarily in
              frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions. The proportion of
              alterations was associated with diagnosis and cognitive and
              clinical characteristics within clinical groups. Patients with
              schizophrenia, on average, had significantly reduced gray matter

              with bipolar disorder, mean deviations were primarily present in
              cerebellar regions. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found
              that group-level differences disguised biological heterogeneity
              and interindividual differences among patients with the same
              diagnosis. This finding suggests that the idea of the average

  abstract = "Elucidating the neurobiological effects of sleep and wake is an
              important goal of the neurosciences. Whether and how human
              cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes during the sleep-wake cycle
              remain to be clarified. Based on the synaptic homeostasis
              hypothesis of sleep and wake, we hypothesized that a day of wake
              and a night of sleep deprivation would be associated with gray
              matter resting CBF (rCBF) increases and that sleep would be
              associated with rCBF decreases. Thirty-eight healthy adult males
              (age 22.1 $\pm$ 2.5 years) underwent arterial spin labeling
              perfusion magnetic resonance imaging at three time points: in the
              morning after a regular night's sleep, the evening of the same
              day, and the next morning, either after total sleep deprivation
              (n = 19) or a night of sleep (n = 19). All analyses were adjusted
              for hematocrit and head motion. rCBF increased from morning to
              evening and decreased after a night of sleep. These effects were
              most prominent in bilateral hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and
              in the occipital and sensorimotor cortices. Group $\times$ time
              interaction analyses for evening versus next morning revealed
              significant interaction in bilateral lateral and medial occipital
              cortices and in bilateral insula, driven by rCBF increases in the
              sleep deprived individuals and decreases in the sleepers,
              respectively. Furthermore, group $\times$ time interaction
              analyses for first morning versus next morning showed significant
              effects in medial and lateral occipital cortices, in anterior
              cingulate gyrus, and in the insula, in both hemispheres. These
              effects were mainly driven by CBF increases from TP1 to TP3 in
              the sleep deprived individuals. There were no associations
              between the rCBF changes and sleep characteristics, vigilant
              attention, or subjective sleepiness that remained significant
              after adjustments for multiple analyses. Altogether, these
              results encourage future studies to clarify mechanisms underlying

               Experimental evidence supports a cerebral metabolic shift taking
               place during sleep that suppresses aerobic glycolysis, a
               hallmark of environment-oriented waking behavior and synaptic
               plasticity. Recent studies reveal that glial astrocytes respond

               volume, composition and glymphatic drainage of interstitial
               fluid. These events are accompanied by changes in neuronal
               discharge patterns, astrocyte--neuron interactions, synaptic

              Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent

              reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many

              subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance
              images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a
              dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs
              in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then
              encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to
              automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the
              intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we
              used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new
              method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of
              mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When
              compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly
              accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs,
              and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and
              inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between
              the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated

               localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and
               disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of
               standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a

              caffeine intake and exposure to blue-emitting light. In addition,

              estimations of non-Gaussian diffusion metrics obtained from

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Elucidating the neurobiological effects of sleep and
              waking remains an important goal of the neurosciences. Recently,
              animal studies indicated that sleep is important for cell
              membrane and myelin maintenance in the brain and that these
              structures are particularly susceptible to insufficient sleep.
              Here, we tested the hypothesis that a day of waking and sleep
              deprivation would be associated with changes in diffusion tensor
              imaging (DTI) indices of white matter microstructure sensitive to
              axonal membrane and myelin alterations. METHODS: Twenty-one
              healthy adult males underwent DTI in the morning [7:30AM; time
              point (TP)1], after 14 hours of waking (TP2), and then after
              another 9 hours of waking (TP3). Whole brain voxel-wise analysis
              was performed with tract based spatial statistics. RESULTS: A day
              of waking was associated with widespread increases in white
              matter fractional anisotropy, which were mainly driven by radial
              diffusivity reductions, and sleep deprivation was associated with
              widespread fractional anisotropy decreases, which were mainly
              explained by reductions in axial diffusivity. In addition, larger
              decreases in axial diffusivity after sleep deprivation were
              associated with greater sleepiness. All DTI changes remained
              significant after adjusting for hydration measures. CONCLUSIONS:
              This is the first DTI study of sleep deprivation in humans.
              Although previous studies have observed localized changes in DTI
              indices of cerebral microstructure over the course of a few
              hours, further studies are needed to confirm widespread DTI
              changes within hours of waking and to clarify whether such
              changes in white matter microstructure serve as neurobiological
              substrates of sleepiness.",
